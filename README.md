# guess

This is a fun little guessing game that allows the user to guess the random number from 0 to 500. 
The user has 10 tries to guess the random number generated by the browser.
A correct guess will alert the user they have won the game.
A incorrect guess will alert the user the number they entered is either too high or too low.
If the user exhuasts all 10 guesses they lose the game and need to restart to try again.

This game uses vanilla js in the head of the guess.htm file.
The live version of the application can be found here:
